**Codevalon** is the supreme judge of developers. It is an AI entity that analyzes your GitHub profile, code history, commits, and programming activity to assign you a score from **0 to 1000**.

- **0** – Beginner: Just started your journey.
- **1000** – Legendary: Among the greatest coders in the world.

This score is not just for fun — it is a **serious evaluation metric**. Codevalon's algorithm is capable of measuring a developer's skill level with **remarkable accuracy**, making it suitable even for **HR departments** to assess the potential of candidates during recruitment.

## 🔁 Continuous Monitoring

Once you submit your GitHub profile to Codevalon, the AI begins continuous analysis of your activity. Every day, your score can go up or down based on your new commits and coding behavior. You are constantly evolving — and so is your rank.
